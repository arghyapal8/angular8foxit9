Setup Steps !! sss

1. Download the Foxit SDK version 9.0 from the following link: https://cdn-sdk.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-sdk/download/foxit-pdf-sdk-for-web/pcmobile/9.x/9.0/FoxitPDFSDKForWeb_9_0_0_Full.zip After the download is complete, proceed to unzip the package.

2. Inside the unzipped package, locate the "lib" folder. Rename this folder to "foxit-lib". Once renamed, move (or copy) this folder to the "src" directory within the Angular project, such that the destination path is "my-angular8-project\src".

3. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location where your "package.json" file is located. This should be in the root directory of "my-angular8-project". Once there, run the command npm install to install all the necessary project dependencies.

4. To start your Angular project, use the Angular CLI command ng serve. After entering this command, press Enter.

5. Once the project is successfully compiled and running, open your preferred web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. This is where your Angular project will be live and accessible for interaction.
